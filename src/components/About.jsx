        As an enthusiastic learner, I have pursued my interests in various fields of technology, including 3D game development, web security, and DevOps. In 3D game development, I have learned various game engines and frameworks, including Unity and Unreal Engine, and created game assets using tools like Blender and Maya. Additionally, I have delved into web security, gaining expertise in server-side vulnerabilities like code injection and SQL injection, and client-side vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting and cookie manipulation. I also have experience in DevOps, including continuous integration and delivery, containerization, and deployment using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins. My passion for technology and my dedication to learning have allowed me to complete real-world projects and develop valuable skills that I can apply to my future endeavors.
